Dotfiles
========
This repository contains my custom dotfiles and a install script to symlink them from
my home directory. It is based on Michael Smalley's article [Using Git and GitHub to Manage Your Dotfiles](http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/). Further details are forthcoming.
